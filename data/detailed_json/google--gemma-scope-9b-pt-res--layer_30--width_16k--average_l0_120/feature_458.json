Additionally, partial word activations (e.g., \\\"er\\\", \\\"s\\\", \\\"rol\\\", \\\"ge\\\") suggest that models attend to morphological and lexical fragments, particularly in compound or technical terms. The frequent presence of \\\"your\\\" and possessive markers indicates a focus on personalized or user-centered language.",
